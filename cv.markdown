Technical Skills
----------------

I consider myself a T shaped developer. I try to have some experience in every area of Software Development.


### Languages

I am particularly skilled in:
- Scala
- Node.js
- Python
- Bash

I consider myself tool-agnostic so while I am particularly skilled in the languages above I am proficient in the following and feel confident in saying I could become high specialised in them within weeks:
- Java
- Ruby
- Javascript 5
- CSS
- HTML
- C#
- Objective C


### Development Environments

- I primarily work on Mac OSX.
- I use VMs for development, primarily CentOS and Ubuntu.
- I am fluent in use of the Bash and Zsh prompts.
- My primary editors are MacVim and Sublime Text.


### Infrastructure

- I have practical experience using Puppet and Ansible.
- On teams I lead I emphasise Devops, by supporting developers learning to build infrastructure automation and deployment code.
- I would like to further my experience in these tools.
- I make use of VirtualBox and Vagrant for development environments, though I would like to deepen my understanding of them.


### Component and Architecture Design

- I led the team that built the Frontend for the [Register to Vote service](https://gov.uk/register-to-vote). The component design of that application was entirely my own work.
- I led a team of 4 Developers in DWP building a system to integrate with the GOV.UK Verify system. I designed the architecture of that system, with input from DWPs Technical Architects.
- I led a team of 4 Developers and 2 Testers in Land Registry in building a service for signing mortgage deeds online. I designed the architecture for that system iteratively based on discussions with the Product Owner and investigation of the requirements with the Land Registry SMEs.
- I am capable and proficient at taking a vision for a product and designing an architecture that can fulfil it.


Leadership skills
-----------------


### Agile Project Planning

- I have led Product Owners and Business Analysts in reshaping their Waterfall plan into a Backlog of User focused stories.
- I am skilled at teaching others how to approach writing User Stories and training them in Agile development.
- I have experience working on teams as a Scrum Master, mediating disputes, clearing up miscommunication, and finding solutions to blockers. 


### Best practice

- I gently enforce best practice approach to testing and code quality through code reviews and pair programming.
- I use targeted pair refactoring to work with members of a team to simultaneously clean up areas of the codebase that are in need of refactoring and teach good practices to the team.
- I encourage my teams to own their code through to live operation, owning their deployment pipeline or collaborating closely with Ops. I am a big proponent of Devops.
- I take a pragmatic approach to reuse of code, asking my developers to follow the Rule of 3, "rewrite it three times before writing a reuseable solution".
- I look to automate repetitive tasks at every step of development, from automated build, deployment and testing.


### Mentoring and Coaching

- I mentor team members through both technical and career issues, helping them find a solution to their challenges.
- As a Certified Scrum Master I facilitate the team in improving itself.
- On multiple projects I have mentored team members from inexperienced to proficient with a language.
- On multiple projects I have helped teams implement and follow the Agile principles, using Scrum and Kanban techniques where needed, to better understand their users and develop an efficient team.
