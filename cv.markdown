Michael Allen
=============

A highly skilled and respected professional developer with 4 years' experience
delivering working software for government projects as part of Agile teams. I
follow a clean, systematic approach to Agile software delivery, employing
industry best practices where appropriate.

As a tool-agnostic developer I quickly pick up new technologies, fast becoming
an expert, and feeding that back into the team. As a technical lead I take a
hands-on approach to mentoring and team improvement, upskilling team members
through pair programming and one-on-one coaching.

I'm able to step up and fill the roles missing in teams. On projects I have
filled in as Scrum Master, Business Analyst, and Architect where necessary.
I am dedicated, flexible, and reliable, a valuable addition to any team.
